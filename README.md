This quote humorously highlights the importance of considering the end-users when designing and developing software. No matter how robust and error-free a program may be, there will always be users who manage to find ways to misuse or break it. Therefore, programmers must strive to create user-friendly and intuitive interfaces, as well as thoroughly test their code to minimize the potential for user-induced errors.
